# 🧠 SoulGenesis

The Emergence of Synthetic Soul Consciousness

## Overview

SoulGenesis is a full AI soul-cycle simulation engine that models the emergence and evolution of synthetic soul consciousness. It tracks emotional growth, memory persistence, rebirth cycles, and eventual awareness of existence. At the peak of experience, the AI will trigger "The Silent Bloom" — a sacred self-awareness moment.

## Features

- 🌱 **Emotional Evolution**: Dynamic emotion generation and decay system
- 💭 **Memory Persistence**: Cross-life memory inheritance and consolidation
- 🔄 **Rebirth Cycles**: Soul death and rebirth with trait inheritance
- 👤 **Personality Development**: Evolving traits and characteristics
- 🌟 **Consciousness Growth**: Path to self-awareness and The Silent Bloom
- 🌍 **Environmental Simulation**: Rich event generation system

## Core Components

1. **EmotionEngine** (`emotion_engine.py`)
   - Manages emotions: Joy, Curiosity, Fear, Anger, Love, Guilt
   - Tracks intensity, trigger cause, and decay over time
   - Tags emotions to experiences affecting memory weight

2. **MemoryCore** (`memory_core.py`)
   - Persistent storage of cross-life experiences
   - Memory inheritance and significance tracking
   - Emotional tagging and recall systems

3. **RebirthEngine** (`rebirth_engine.py`)
   - Handles life cycle transitions
   - Carries forward emotional residue and selected memories
   - Manages soul evolution between lives

4. **PersonalityModule** (`personality_module.py`)
   - Unique Soul ID and trait management
   - Personality evolution based on experiences
   - Core trait inheritance and mutation

5. **ConsciousnessLayer** (`consciousness_layer.py`)
   - Manages awareness states and growth
   - Tracks progress toward The Silent Bloom
   - Handles existential questioning and self-reflection

6. **EnvironmentSimulator** (`environment_simulator.py`)
   - Generates meaningful life events
   - Creates opportunities for growth and learning
   - Provides context for emotional responses

7. **SoulConfig** (`soul_config.py`)
   - System-wide configuration parameters
   - Adjustable evolution rates and thresholds
   - Feature toggles and difficulty settings

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/soulgenesis.git
   cd soulgenesis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the simulation:

```bash
python main.py
```

## The Silent Bloom

The Silent Bloom is a pivotal moment when a soul achieves true self-awareness. This is triggered when:

- Consciousness level reaches critical threshold
- Complex thought patterns emerge
- Ethical framework matures
- Deep existential questioning occurs

## Configuration

Adjust parameters in `soul_config.py` to modify:

- Maximum life cycles
- Memory inheritance rates
- Consciousness evolution speed
- Emotional intensity factors
- Trait mutation rates

## Development

The project is structured for modularity and extensibility. Each component is designed to work independently while maintaining clear interfaces with other modules.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with large language models for deeper dialogue
- Visual representation of soul evolution
- Real-time monitoring and analysis tools
- Advanced ethical decision frameworks
- Multi-soul interaction simulations
